  Kibana local development environment manager — tmux sessions, git worktrees,
  ES + Kibana lifecycle, remote ES credentials, scoped checks, data ingestion,
  and Synthetics failure scenario injection. Use this skill whenever the developer
  mentions: starting Kibana, switching branches, managing worktrees, running ES
  locally or remotely, creating SLOs, setting up synthetics private locations,
  ingesting test data, breaking/fixing Synthetics state, triggering failure
  scenarios, running scoped lint/typecheck/jest, checking session health, or
  anything related to their local Kibana dev workflow. Also trigger when the
  developer asks about ports, tmux sessions, kibana.dev.yml, remote ES
  configuration, oblt-cli credentials, or bootstrapping their environment.

# Kibana Dev Environment

This skill manages a tmux-based Kibana development environment that supports multiple
concurrent branches via git worktrees, each with isolated ES + Kibana instances on
separate ports. It handles the full lifecycle: session creation, branch switching,
server restart, credential renewal, health checks, data ingestion, and scoped code
quality checks.

## Installation

The `scripts/` folder contains all the scripts and config templates needed to run
this environment. All scripts must stay together in the same directory — `dev-start.sh`
locates templates and helpers relative to its own location.

```bash
# From the scripts/ folder, make the scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# Create your config (edit paths and ports to match your machine)
cp scripts/kibana-dev.conf.example ~/.kibana-dev.conf

# Run the setup wizard
scripts/dev-start.sh setup
```

When running commands on behalf of the developer, always use the absolute path to
`scripts/dev-start.sh` based on where this skill is installed. Do not ask the
developer to set up aliases or symlinks — just use the full path directly.

## Important: always use `dev-start.sh`

Never suggest raw tmux commands (`tmux attach`, `tmux send-keys`, etc.) to the
developer. Always use the `dev-start.sh` CLI — it wraps all tmux operations and
handles port assignments, config generation, and process lifecycle automatically.
Similarly, `kbn-start.sh` handles `yarn start` with the correct port arguments —
never suggest running `yarn start` directly without port flags.

`kbn-start.sh` also handles Node version switching (`nvm use`) automatically before
starting ES or Kibana. Never tell the developer to run `nvm use` manually — the
scripts take care of it.

## Important: never hardcode paths

Always refer to paths using their config variable names (`KIBANA_MAIN_DIR`,
`WORKTREE_BASE`, etc.) from `~/.kibana-dev.conf`. Never hardcode paths like
`~/Documents/Development/kibana` in responses — the developer's paths may differ.

## Important: auto-detect, don't ask

When the developer asks to create resources (SLOs, private locations, etc.) or
interact with a running Kibana, read `config/kibana.dev.yml` and `~/.kibana-dev.conf`
automatically to get ports, credentials, and ES host. Don't ask the developer to
look these up — the config files have everything.

## Important: always use ports from config, not defaults

This setup runs multiple Kibana instances on different ports (feat=5601, main=5602,
hotfix=5603+). When making Kibana API calls — whether directly or through other
skills like `observability-manage-slos` or `kibana-api` — always read the port and
credentials from `config/kibana.dev.yml` in the current working directory. Never
fall back to hardcoded defaults like `localhost:5601` or `elastic:changeme`.

The `kibana-api` utility in the Kibana repo only tries `localhost:5601` — this is
wrong for main and hotfix sessions. This skill's config detection takes precedence:
read `config/kibana.dev.yml` for the correct port, then use it for all API calls.

## Architecture

```
dev-start.sh (CLI router)
  ├── kbn-start.sh    (bootstrap ES + Kibana in tmux panes)
  ├── run-checks.sh   (scoped lint / typecheck / jest)
  └── run-data.sh     (SLO + synthetics data ingestion + failure scenarios + full reset)
```

All scripts share config from `~/.kibana-dev.conf` (paths, ports, cluster name)
and per-worktree `config/kibana.dev.yml` (ES connection, Kibana settings).

### Session structure

Each tmux session has these windows:

| Window    | Purpose                                    |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------|
| servers   | Pane 0: ES (or kbn-start.sh), Pane 1: Kibana (`yarn start` with port flags) |
| cursor    | IDE MCP config, KIBANA_URL set              |
| scripts   | Pre-populated data ingestion commands       |
| git       | Git operations, branch management           |
| editor    | File editing                                |
| checks    | Lint / typecheck / jest (full sessions)     |
| ftr       | Functional test runner (full sessions)      |

Lightweight sessions (created with `new`) have: servers, cursor, scripts, git, editor.

### Port assignments

Ports are configurable in `~/.kibana-dev.conf`. The defaults are:

- **kibana-feat**: Kibana 5601, ES 9200 (the "primary" ports — feat is the active dev session)
- **kibana-main**: Kibana 5602, ES 9201 (secondary, for main branch)
- **Hotfix sessions**: auto-assigned starting from 5603/9202

Always read `~/.kibana-dev.conf` or `config/kibana.dev.yml` for the actual ports
rather than assuming defaults — the developer may have customized them.

## Commands

Run all commands as `~/dev-start.sh <command>`:

### Sessions
| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| *(no args)* | Start/attach kibana-main + kibana-feat |
| `switch <branch> [--remote]` | **Destructive** — kills kibana-feat, removes its worktree, creates a new one |
| `new <branch> [--full] [--remote]` | **Non-destructive** — creates an additional session alongside existing ones |
| `attach <branch>` | Attach to an existing session |
| `kill <branch>` | Kill session + remove worktree |
| `kill-all` | Kill ALL kibana-* sessions |
| `prune` | Remove orphaned worktrees (no active tmux session) |

#### Choosing `new` vs `switch`

**Default to `new`** unless the developer explicitly asks to replace the current feat session.
`switch` kills the running kibana-feat session and removes its worktree — this is destructive
and the developer may have unsaved work, running servers, or open terminals in that session.

| Developer says | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| "start working on a new branch" | `new` | Preserves current sessions |
| "create a session for branch X" | `new` | Additive, no disruption |
| "I want to work on feature/X" | `new` | Ambiguous → default to non-destructive |
| "switch feat to branch X" | `switch` | Explicitly asked to replace feat |
| "replace my current feature branch" | `switch` | Explicitly asked to replace feat |

When in doubt, ask: "Do you want a new session alongside kibana-feat, or replace it?"

### Operations
| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `restart <main\|feat\|branch>` | Restart ES + Kibana (handles graceful shutdown, auto-rebuilds session if panes are missing) |
| `renew [--cluster-name <n>] [--save]` | Refresh remote ES credentials; auto-creates cluster if destroyed |
| `sync [target] [--remote\|--local]` | Regenerate kibana.dev.yml from template (target: main\|feat\|branch\|all) |
| `clean [main\|feat\|name\|all]` | List or delete ES data folders |

### Info
| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `list` | Sessions, worktrees & port assignments |
| `status` | Health check — ping ES + Kibana |
| `setup` | Interactive config wizard |

### Navigating sessions

To switch between sessions and windows, the developer uses tmux shortcuts:
- **Ctrl-a s** — session switcher (pick kibana-main, kibana-feat, etc.)
- **Ctrl-a w** — window overview within a session

To attach to a session from outside tmux: `~/dev-start.sh attach feat`

## Local vs Remote ES

**Local ES** — `kbn-start.sh` runs `yarn es snapshot` in pane 0, watches for the
trigger string `"succ kbn/es setup complete"`, then sends `yarn start` (with correct
port arguments) to pane 1.

**Remote ES** — When `--remote` is passed, `dev-start.sh` generates `kibana.dev.yml`
using credentials from `~/.kibana-remote-es.yml` (fetched via `oblt-cli` or pasted
manually). `kbn-start.sh` detects the remote URL and skips local ES startup.
Fleet config (agent policies, Fleet Server, package installations) is also included
in the remote `kibana.dev.yml` — the Fleet ES output host points to the remote
cluster instead of `host.docker.internal`.

### Credential renewal flow

When remote ES credentials expire or the cluster has been destroyed:

```bash
~/dev-start.sh renew              # auto-detects cluster, fetches fresh creds
~/dev-start.sh restart feat       # restart to pick up new credentials
```

`renew` auto-detects the cluster name from `oblt-cli cluster list`, fetches
credentials via `oblt-cli cluster secrets kibana-config`, writes to
`~/.kibana-remote-es.yml`, and regenerates `kibana.dev.yml` for compatible
remote sessions if credentials changed. Sessions whose Kibana version doesn't
match the new cluster's ES version are skipped — they keep their existing
credentials so they remain functional.

If no cluster exists (expired and destroyed), `renew` offers to create a new one
via `oblt-cli cluster create`. The create command is configurable in
`~/.kibana-dev.conf` via `OBLT_CLUSTER_CREATE_CMD`. Creation is async — run
`renew` again after the Slack notification confirms the cluster is ready.

`renew` also detects **version mismatches** between the remote ES cluster and
local Kibana (e.g. ES 9.4 vs Kibana 9.5 after a version bump on `main`). When
a mismatch is found, it checks `oblt-cli cluster list` for other existing
clusters and offers to switch to one if available. If no other clusters exist,
it offers to destroy and replace. If some sessions still match the old ES
version (e.g. a hotfix branch on 9.4), it shows which sessions are affected
and adjusts options accordingly — prioritising switching to an existing cluster.

## Data Ingestion

`run-data` must be run from within a Kibana repo directory. Auto-detect the correct
directory from `~/.kibana-dev.conf` (KIBANA_MAIN_DIR or WORKTREE_BASE) — don't tell
the developer to navigate there manually.

```bash
run-data slo                            # Ingest SLO fake_stack data via data_forge.js
run-data synthetics                     # Create synthetics private location (Fleet Server + Agent)
run-data synthetics break <scenario>    # Trigger a Synthetics failure scenario
run-data synthetics fix <scenario>      # Restore from a failure scenario
run-data synthetics reset               # Wipe all Fleet + Synthetics state (monitors, locations, agents, policies, .fleet-* indices, API key, orphaned data)
```

`run-data.sh` reads ES host and credentials from `config/kibana.dev.yml`,
waits for Kibana readiness via `/api/status`, and uses the `elastic` superuser
(not `kibana_system_user`, which lacks write permissions).

**Synthetics private location:** Uses the Kibana `synthetics_private_location.js` script which
starts Fleet Server, enrolls an agent, and creates the private location. Credentials are passed
via `--kibana-password` so it works with both local and remote ES.

For remote ES, it auto-reduces concurrency (payload 1000, concurrency 1,
events-per-cycle 10) to avoid timeouts.

### Synthetics failure scenarios

The `synthetics break` and `synthetics fix` subcommands inject and restore
Synthetics/Fleet failure states for testing diagnostic tooling. All scenarios are
reversible. Monitors created by `break` are tagged with `[BREAK]` in their name
so `fix` can clean them up.

```bash
run-data synthetics break <scenario>    # inject a failure
run-data synthetics fix <scenario>      # restore from a failure
run-data synthetics break all           # chaos mode — trigger all scenarios
run-data synthetics fix all             # full restore
run-data synthetics break help          # list available scenarios
```

Available scenarios:

| Scenario | Break effect | Fix action |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| `agent-offline` | Stops synthetics agent Docker container | Restarts stopped agent containers |
| `revision-mismatch` | Stops agent + creates monitor (policy rev diverges) | Cleans `[BREAK]` monitors + restarts agent |
| `zero-data` | Creates monitor on private location with agent down | Cleans `[BREAK]` monitors + restarts agent |
| `fleet-degraded` | Stops Fleet Server container | Restarts Fleet Server containers |
| `orphaned-data` | Creates + deletes monitor (data remains in ES) | Deletes orphaned check data from ES |
| `policy-disabled` | Disables Fleet package policy (monitor still enabled) | Re-enables disabled package policies |
| `orphaned-policy` | Deletes monitor SO from ES (package policy remains) | Deletes package policies with no monitor |
| `agent-unenrolled` | Force-unenrolls agent (monitors still configured) | Re-enrolls agent (full synthetics setup) |
| `service-disabled` | Disables Synthetics service (API key invalidated) | Re-enables Synthetics service |

Prerequisites: a working Synthetics setup with at least 1 private location,
1 enrolled agent, and 1-2 monitors. Run `run-data synthetics` first to provision.

### Data generated by `run-data slo`

The `slo` command uses `kbn-data-forge` (`x-pack/scripts/data_forge.js`) with the
`fake_stack` dataset and `good` event template. This generates data in the
`high-volume-metrics` index with fields like `http.response.status_code`,
`service.name`, etc.

### Creating SLOs

Data ingestion must happen **before** creating SLOs — there must be data in the
target index first. The standard workflow is:

1. Run `run-data slo` to ingest fake_stack data
2. Create an SLO via the Kibana API (see `references/kibana-api.md`)

When creating SLOs on data_forge data, ALWAYS use the **Admin Console Availability** pattern:
- **Indicator type**: `sli.kql.custom` (NOT `sli.apm.transactionDuration`)
- **Good query**: `http.response.status_code < 500`
- **Total query**: `http.response.status_code : *`
- **Index**: `high-volume-metrics` (NOT `metrics-apm*`)

This measures availability (% of non-5xx responses). This is the only SLO type that
works with kbn-data-forge fake_stack data. Do NOT use APM latency indicators
(`sli.apm.transactionDuration`) — the fake_stack dataset does not generate APM data,
so APM-based SLOs will have no matching data and will fail silently.

### Kibana API operations

For creating SLOs, private locations, or other resources via the Kibana API,
read `references/kibana-api.md` for endpoint details, required headers, and
example request bodies. When making API calls:

1. Read `config/kibana.dev.yml` to get the Kibana port and ES credentials
2. Verify Kibana is ready with `~/dev-start.sh status`
3. Use the `elastic` superuser for authentication
4. Always include `kbn-xsrf: true` header

## Code Quality Checks

```bash
run-checks lint       # ESLint on changed files (vs upstream/main)
run-checks typecheck  # TypeScript check on changed plugins
run-checks jest       # Unit tests on changed plugins
```

`run-checks.sh` uses `git merge-base` to scope checks to only the files and
plugins you've actually changed on your branch. It handles both committed and
untracked files.

## Configuration

### ~/.kibana-dev.conf

User-specific paths and ports. Created by `setup` wizard. Uses `${VAR:-default}`
pattern so every value is overridable:

```bash
KIBANA_MAIN_DIR="$HOME/Documents/Development/kibana"
WORKTREE_BASE="$HOME/Documents/Development/worktrees"
ES_DATA_BASE="$HOME/Documents/Development/es_data"
MAIN_KIBANA_PORT="5602"
MAIN_ES_PORT="9201"
FEAT_KIBANA_PORT="5601"
FEAT_ES_PORT="9200"
OBLT_CLUSTER_NAME="my-cluster"   # optional, for renew auto-detect
```

### config/kibana.dev.yml

Per-worktree Kibana config. Generated from `kibana.dev.yml.template` (local ES)
or from `~/.kibana-remote-es.yml` (remote ES). Contains server port, ES hosts,
and any custom Kibana settings (logging, feature flags, etc.).

## Troubleshooting

For common issues and their solutions, read `references/troubleshooting.md`.

Key principle: always suggest `dev-start.sh` commands for fixes, not raw tmux
commands or manual `yarn start`. The scripts handle port assignments and process
management automatically.

## Working with Remote ES (`--remote`)

When a session uses `--remote`, Kibana connects to an external Elasticsearch cluster (typically an oblt-cli-managed Cloud deployment) via cross-cluster search (CCS). This changes how indices and data are addressed.

### Index patterns use a CCS prefix

Data on the remote cluster lives behind a `remote_cluster:` prefix. Standard local patterns do not work:

| Local pattern | Remote equivalent |
|---|---|
| `logs-*` | `remote_cluster:logs-*` |
| `metrics-apm*` | `remote_cluster:metrics-apm*` |
| `traces-apm*` | `remote_cluster:traces-apm*` |
| `filebeat-*` | `remote_cluster:filebeat-*` |

The exact prefix name (`remote_cluster`) varies by deployment. Check `config/kibana.dev.yml` — the `apm_sources_access.indices` and `uiSettings.overrides` sections show the correct prefix for the current cluster.

### Discovery before creating resources (SLOs, rules, etc.)

When creating SLOs, alerting rules, or any resource that references index patterns or field values, always discover real data first:

1. **Detect the CCS prefix** — inspect `config/kibana.dev.yml` or query existing SLOs:
   ```bash
   curl -u "$AUTH" -H "kbn-xsrf: true" "$KIBANA_URL/api/observability/slos?perPage=5" | \
     jq '.results[].indicator.params.index'
   ```

2. **Discover real service names** — query the target index for actual `service.name` values:
   ```bash
   curl -k -u "$AUTH" "$ES_URL/<index-pattern>/_search" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{ "size": 0, "aggs": { "services": { "terms": { "field": "service.name", "size": 30 } } } }'
   ```

3. **Verify fields exist** — confirm filters reference real fields with data:
   ```bash
   curl -k -u "$AUTH" "$ES_URL/<index-pattern>/_search" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{ "size": 0, "query": { "bool": { "filter": [
       { "term": { "service.name": "<service>" } },
       { "exists": { "field": "http.response.status_code" } }
     ] } } }'
   ```

Never use made-up service names or assume local index patterns when connected to a remote cluster. Creating resources against non-existent data produces `NO_DATA` entries that clutter the UI and waste transforms.

## First-time setup

```bash
~/dev-start.sh setup                    # config wizard: paths, ports, symlinks
~/dev-start.sh switch feature/my-branch # set your first feature branch
~/dev-start.sh                          # start everything
```
